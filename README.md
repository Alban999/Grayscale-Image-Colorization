# Grayscale-Image-Colorization

Coloring a picture from a black and white image can be a daunting task. Today, thanks to AI based on grayscale image colorization, it can be done automatically. It can be very helpful in various fields such as in medicine to better interpret and analyze medical images. In this report, such a method using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be presented. The aim here is to give to an image colors plausible to the human eye since some elements can have arbitrary colors like a ball, a shoe, etc.

During this project, two different approaches have been investigated. The first one is based on regression and the other on classification methods. Their results will be compared and discussed.
